# snake-game
I have developed a basic version of the classic game "Snake" using HTML and JavaScript. The game consists of controlling a snake that moves around the screen and eats apples, which causes the snake to grow in length. The player must avoid the snake colliding with its own body or the walls of the game area.

By creating this game, I was able to practice my HTML and JavaScript skills, as well as learn more about game development. It was a fun and rewarding project, and I hope to continue improving upon it in the future.
